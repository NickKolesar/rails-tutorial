<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This website was created for educational purposes as part of the
  <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>. 
  It is a twitter like microblogging site where you can make an account,
  post 140 character messages, and follow other users. The site includes
  basic web components including account activation, password reset, log-in,
  session tracking, and more using the Ruby on Rails framework. As it is
  a site created for educational purposes, it is unlikely to actually have an 
  active user base.
